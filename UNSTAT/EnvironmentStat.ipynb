The phasing out of ODS, and their substitution by less harmful substances or new processes, are aimed at the recovery of the ozone layer. The indicators signify progress made towards meeting the commitments to phase out the use of ODS in countries which have ratified the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and its Amendments of London (1990), Copenhagen (1992), Montreal (1997) and Beijing (1999). Substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol are categorised into annexes, with different groups in each annex. These include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) (Annex A, group I), halons (Annex A, group II), methyl bromide (Annex E, group I) among others. In the table, All ODS refers to the aggregate consumption, in ODP tonnes, for all of the controlled substance categories that have data available.The consumption data in this table are used to monitor the reduction in the usage of ODS as a result of the Montreal Protocol. Therefore only substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol are covered. Consumption data are calculated by the Ozone Secretariat using data reported in tonnes by the parties. Consumption is calculated as production plus imports minus exports, destroyed quantities, and feedstock uses of a controlled substance. Destruction and feedstock uses both take ODS out of the system (opposite of production), hence the reason for subtracting them when calculating consumption. The protocol also specifies that consumption shall not include the amounts used for quarantine and pre-shipment applications of methyl bromide, and further specifies that exports to non-Parties will count as consumption in the exporting Party.The formula for calculating consumption is: consumption = total production - destroyed - production for internal feedstock use - production for internal quarantine use (for methyl bromide only) + total new imports - import for feedstock - import for quarantine use – total new exports + export to non-parties. Reducing consumption ultimately leads to reductions in emissions since most uses of ODS finally lead to the substances being emitted into the atmosphere. The unit of measurement is metric tonnes of ODS weighted by their Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP), known as ODP tonnes. ODP refers to the amount of ozone depletion caused by a substance. It is the ratio of the impact on ozone of a chemical substance compared to the impact of a similar mass of CFC-11. The ODP of CFC-11 is defined to be 1. CFCs have ODPs that range from 0.6 to 1 while hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) have ODPs that range from 0.001 to 0.52. The halons have ODPs of up to 10 while methyl bromide has an ODP of 0.6.', 'JobType': 'JSON', 'CleanPush': True, 'Server': 'str', 'UseJsonFormatForSQL': False, 'CleanReplace': True, 'MergeSchema': False, 'tags': [{'name': 'Air Pollution'}], 'additional_data_sources': [{'name': 'UNSD Millennium Development Goals Database.', 'url': 'http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Default.aspx.'}], 'limitations': 'Countries that are Party to the Montreal protocol report data annually to the Secretariat using data reporting formats agreed by the Parties.', 'concept': '', 'periodicity': '', 'topic': 'Air Pollution', 'created': '', 'last_modified': '', 'TriggerTalend': False, 'SavePathForJsonOutput': ''}}\n"

This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO2, N2O and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Total GHG emissions including LULUCF/LUCF refer to greenhouse gases emissions including emissions/removals from the forestry sector. The definition is different for Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. For Annex I Parties, the sector is called Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) whereas for non-Annex I Parties, it is called Land-use Change and Forestry (LUCF). These two definitions are close but not equivalent. Land use, land use change and forest may have an impact on the surface albedo, evapotranspiration, sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, or other properties of the climate system and may thus have a radioactive forcing and/or other impacts on climate, locally or globally. Data on greenhouse gas emissions are usually estimated according to international methodologies on the basis of national statistics on energy, industrial and agricultural production, waste management and land use, etc. The best known and most widely used methodology is the 1996 Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) which is the basis for reporting to the UNFCCC.

Instances of hazardous waste treated or disposed being greater than hazardous waste generated (e.g. a figure greater than 100%) are possible, because, aside from generating hazardous waste, a country may import or export it, and may also have an existing stock of hazardous waste at the beginning of a given year.\\nIn the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (http://www.basel.int/), 164 countries agreed to minimize the generation of hazardous waste, to assure sound management of hazardous wastes, to control transboundary movement of hazardous wastes; and to improve institutional and technical capabilities especially for developing countries and countries with economies in transition. At later meetings, Parties agreed to a ban on the export of hazardous wastes from OECD to non-OECD countries (\\'Basel ban\\').\\nHazardous waste is waste that owing to its toxic, infectious, radioactive or flammable properties poses an actual or potential hazard to the health of humans, other living organisms, or the environment.  Hazardous waste here refers to categories of waste to be controlled according to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal (Article 1 and Annex I).  If data are not available according to the Basel Convention, amounts can be given according to national definitions.\\nHazardous waste treated or disposed corresponds to the hazardous waste that was either recycled, incinerated, landfilled or other. For all data sourced from Eurostat, it is referred to as \"Total waste treatment\".\\nRecycling corresponds to any reprocessing of waste material in a production process that diverts it from the waste stream, except reuse as fuel.  Both reprocessing as the same type of product, and for different purposes should be included. Recycling within industrial plants i.e., at the place of generation should be excluded. According to the European regulation, and for all data sourced from Eurostat, this corresponds to what went through a process of \"Recovery other than energy resources - except backfilling\".\\nIncineration corresponds to the controlled combustion of waste with or without energy recovery. For all data sourced from Eurostat, hazardous waste incinerated refers to the variables \"Incineration / disposal\" + \"Incineration / energy recovery\".\\nLandfilling refers to the final placement of waste into or onto the land in a controlled or uncontrolled way. The definition covers both landfilling in internal sites (i.e., where a generator of waste is carrying out its own waste disposal at the place of generation) and in external sites. For all data sourced from Eurostat, it corresponds to the variable \"Landfill / Disposal (D1-D7, D12)\".\\nOther corresponds to any final treatment or disposal different from recycling, incineration and landfilling.
