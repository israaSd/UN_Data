Data are computed geospatially using Tier 1 default factors of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National greenhouse gas (GHG) Inventories and of the Supplement on Wetlands (IPCC, 2006; 2014) for the organic soils component. Estimates are available by country and with global coverage, in complete time series for the period 1990–2021. The database is updated annually.\\nThe FAOSTAT domain Fires disseminates information by country on: activity data (in hectares of burned area and tonnes of burned biomass); and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in kilotonnes of N2O, CH4 and CO2). Data are available for all countries and territories, for standard FAOSTAT regional aggregations, and for Annex I and non-Annex I country groups.\\nThe uncertainties in FAOSTAT estimates of emissions from fires in organic soils area very high (IPCC, 2014). FAOSTAT estimates rely on remotely sensed data of burning biomass in areas where organic soils are also mapped. On the one hand, the presence of fires may not always be a signal that the underlying peat layer is burning. On the other hand, remote sensing information has limited capacity to detect the smoldering fires that are typical of peatlands. Furthermore, the methods applied herein do not distinguish between fires on drained and undrained organic soils, rather assuming burning of the organic layer in both cases. Existing literature and country reports support FAOSTAT country estimates in South East Asia (e.g. Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam), where burning of the organic layer is associated with deforestation fires and drainage. In all other countries, absence of literature and lack of other evidence suggest that FAOSTAT emissions data from fires in organic soils should be used with caution, as a tool to investigate possible national hotspots, rather than for evaluating national GHG inventory data. There is insufficient information to date to confirm the actual presence, quantity and causes (i.e. human-induced vs wildfires) of fires in organic soils outside Southeastern Asia.\\nThis FAOSTAT domain also disseminates the activity data and emissions data reported by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on fire disturbance for a range of vegetation types in Forest Land and Grassland and from fires in organic soils. Activity data are sourced from the most recently available GHG National Inventories (NGHGI) or from National Communications. Emission data are sourced directly from the UNFCCC data portal or from Biennial Update Reports (BURs). UNFCCC data are disseminated in FAOSTAT with permission, formalized via a FAO-UNFCCC Memorandum of Understanding.\\nThe IPCC recommends the use of the FAOSTAT database to countries as a tool for NGHGI QA/QC processes and validation of both activity data and emissions estimates (IPCC, 2019).', 'JobType': 'JSON', 'CleanPush': True, 'Server': 'str', 'UseJsonFormatForSQL': False, 'CleanReplace': True, 'MergeSchema': False, 'tags': [{'name': 'Emissions'}], 'additional_data_sources': [{'name': 'FAOSTAT Emissions data are computed based on a number of source data, including:\\n-Burned areas from MODIS MCD64A1 Collection 6 (Giglio et al., 2018); - Fuel biomass consumption values from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.4.(http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_02_Ch2_Generic.pdf); and from - IPCC. 2014. 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands.

Following the recommendation of experts gathered in the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Round Table on hunger measurement, hosted at FAO headquarters in September 2011, an initial set of indicators aiming to capture various aspects of food insecurity is presented here. The choice of the indicators has been informed by expert judgment and the availability of data with sufficient coverage to enable comparisons across regions and over time. Many of these indicators are produced and published elsewhere by FAO and other international organizations. They are reported here in a single database with the aim of building a wide food security information system. More indicators will be added to this set as more data will become available. Indicators are classified along the four dimensions of food security -- availability, access, utilization and stability.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period.

These indices measure the price change between the current and reference periods of the average basket of goods and services purchased by households. The CPI,all items is typically used to measure and monitor inflation, set monetary policy targets, index social benefits such as pensions and unemployment benefits, and to escalate thresholds and credits in the income tax systems and wages in public and private wage contracts.

It is obtained by dividing a current price value of a given aggregate by its real counterpart. When calculated from the major national accounting aggregates such as GDP or agriculture value added, implicit price deflators pertains to wider ranges of goods and services in the economy than that represented by any of the individual price indexes (such as CPIs, PPIs). Movements in an implicit price deflator reflect both changes in price and changes in the composition of the aggregate for which the deflator is calculated.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the FAOSTAT Deflators database, all series are derived from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Analysis of Main Aggregates database (UNSD AMA). In particular, the implicit GDP deflator, the implicit GFCF deflator, the implicit value added deflator of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishery and the implicit value added deflator of Manufacturing are obtained by dividing the series in current prices by those in constant 2015 prices (base year).', 'JobType': 'JSON', 'CleanPush': True, 'Server': 'str', 'UseJsonFormatForSQL': False, 'CleanReplace': True, 'MergeSchema': False, 'tags': [{'name': 'Prices'}], 'additional_data_sources': [{'name': 'The basic source for the dataset is UNSD which receives national accounts data from countries\\n\\nSee link to UNSD data under: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads'}], 'limitations': '', 'concept': '“The GDP deflator (implicit price deflator for GDP) is calculated as GDP at current prices divided by GDP at constant prices multipled by 100 (chained volume estimates or fixed-base volume estimates, depending on countries).\\n\\nGross domestic product (GDP) at constant prices refers to the volume level of GDP. Constant price estimates of GDP are obtained by expressing values in terms of a base period.\\n\\nIn theory, the price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the current period. Two main methods are adopted in practice.\\n\\nThe first, referred to as \"quantity revaluation\", is based on a methodology consistent with the above theory (i.e., by multiplying the current period quantity by the base period price).\\n\\nThe second, commonly referred to as \"price deflation\", involves dividing price indexes into the observed values to obtain the volume estimate.

The IMF is the responsible institution for the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) methodology and annually collects GFS data, including Expenditure by Functions of Government (COFOG). The Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) is an international classification developed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published by the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD), with the aim of categorise governments' functions according to their purposes. The FAO questionnaire aligns with Table 7 of the IMF GFS questionnaire, replicates the relevant aggregates and drills down to request additional detail related to Agriculture. The FAO dataset consists of a time series, from 2001 onwards, of Total Government Expenditure and expenditure in: Economic affairs; Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, along with its three disaggregated subsectors of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing; and Environmental Protection. In addition, expenditure in each detailed function are further disaggregated into Recurrent and Capital expenditure. Additional indicators include the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure, and the Agriculture Orientation Index (ratio between the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture Value Added as Share of GDP). Imputation methods were used to provide a complete and consistent global dataset as some challenges arise with different stages of implementation of the GFS methodology and COFOG classification, and differences in the data collection and reporting at country level. Data are reported for the highest level of government available (Consolidated general government, consolidated central government or budgetary central government) and are available for about 100 countries on a regular basis. In some cases (for example, India and Pakistan), data may reflect the general government sector as per national norm.

The DFA dataset relies on the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS), which provides comprehensive data on development flows from all donors to all recipients since the early 1970s. The use of CRS for compiling the DFA dataset capitalizes on the expertise of the OECD in this area, while minimizing respondents’ burden and avoiding duplication of work. The DFA dataset includes Official Development Assistance (ODA) flows, Other Official Flows (OOFs) and Private Grants reported by donor countries, international organizations and private entities to the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Directorate. The objective of the DFA database is to provide readily available data to enable analysis on aid flows and the purposes they serve, with an emphasis on agriculture, its components, and environmental protection. The data series “Other Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (total)” provides additional information on aid that accrues in fact to agriculture, but is included in aid flows assigned to other sectors. Accrual to agriculture is dedicated from the text and the description of projects. Among the indicators published in the DFA dataset is the Share of Total DFA. This is indicator is computed as a share of total aid flows devoted to “Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing” in Total aid flows, including Official Development Assistance (ODA), Other Official Flows (OOF) and Private Grant for all purposes from all donors. This indicator is conceptually similar to SDG indicator 2.a.2 \"Total official flows to the agriculture sector\", which is under the custodianship of the OECD with FAO as a partner Agency. It is important to underline that SDG 2.a.2 follows a methodology that is different from that of the Share of Total DFA published in FAOSTAT, and is described by OECD in the Handbook available at https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/SDGeHandbook/Indicator+2.a.2 .The computation of SDG indicator 2.a.2 uses ODA and OOF sector-allocable aid flows as a denominator.', 'JobType': 'JSON', 'CleanPush': True, 'Server': 'str', 'UseJsonFormatForSQL': False, 'CleanReplace': True, 'MergeSchema': False, 'tags': [{'name': 'Investment SDG indicator'}], 'additional_data_sources': [{'name': 'The basic source for the DFA dataset is the administrative data on total Development Assistance compiled and maintained by the OECD in its Creditor Reporting System (http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?datasetcode=CRS1) .'}], 'limitations': '', 'concept': \"Commitments and Disbursements (see the OECD's CRS User Guide at http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/crsguide.htm); Agriculture share of ODA; Agriculture Orientation Index; Total aggregates (Agro-industry, General Environment Protection, Food and Nutrition Assistance, Rural Development, Other Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing)\", 'periodicity': '', 'topic': 'Development Flows to Agriculture', 'created': '2016-09-06', 'last_modified': '2020-04-30', 'TriggerTalend': False, 'SavePathForJsonOutput': '//10.30.31.77/data_collection_dump/TestData'}}\n",

FDI may be undertaken by individuals, as well as business entities.The foreign direct investor most often is aiming to gain access to natural resources, to markets, to labour supply, to technology, to ensure security of supplies or to control the quality of a certain product. FDI can be decomposed into two types of investments: mergers and acquisitions (MA) and greenfield investments. The latter type results in the creation of new entities and the setting up of offices, buildings, plants or factories from scratch in a foreign economy. FDI is the sum of equity capital, reinvested earnings and other FDI capital. Equity capital comprises equity in branches, all shares in subsidiaries and associates (except non-participating, preferred shares that are treated as debt securities and are included under other FDI capital) and other contributions such as the provision of machinery. Reinvested earnings consist of the direct investor's share (in proportion to equity participation) of earnings not distributed by the direct investment enterprise. Other FDI capital (loans) includes the borrowing and lending of funds, including debt securities and trade credits between direct investors and direct investment enterprises. FDI inflows and outflows are important for tracking the direct invesment conditions each year. Outward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows record the value of cross-border direct investment transactions from the reporting economy during a year.

It releases time series for a selection of National Accounts variables, including gross domestic product, gross fixed capital formation, industry-level value added and gross output. The database also proposes additional indicators such as per capita GDP, year-on-year growth rates and measures of industry contribution to GDP.All data relating to GDP, GFCF, AFF, and to MAN originates from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates database, which consists of a complete and consistent set of time series of the main National Accounts (NA) aggregates of all UN Members States and other territories in the world for which National Accounts information is available. The UNSD database's content is based on the countries' official NA data reported to UNSD through the annual National Accounts Questionnaire, supplemented with data estimates for any years and countries with incomplete or inconsistent information (See http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Introduction.asp).Series relating to the sub-industry Ag are obtained from the UNSD NA Official Country Data databases while series on the FB, Tob and FBT industry originates from UNIDO INDSTAT2 databases. In order to ensure that sub-industry series are consistent in levels with National Accounts based series, which is needed to support comparability across industries (agriculture vs. agro-industry and sub-industries), we proceed to a rescaling exercise of UNIDO originating series on UNSD National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates data series (See Section 20 for a more detailed description of the data processing steps).\", 'JobType': 'JSON', 'CleanPush': True, 'Server': 'str', 'UseJsonFormatForSQL': False, 'CleanReplace': True, 'MergeSchema': False, 'tags': [{'name': 'Macro-Economic Indicators'}], 'additional_data_sources': [{'name': '* UNSD: National Accounts Analysis of Main Aggregates (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads),* UNdata: UNSD National Accounts Official Country Data (http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=SNA&f=group_code%3a206#SNA) * UNIDO: INDSTAT2 (https://stat.unido.org/database/INDSTAT%202%202021,%20ISIC%20Revision%203)'}], 'limitations': '', 'concept': \"The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the total gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy, at producers' prices, plus taxes on imports, less subsidies on imports, plus non-deductible VAT (Production approach to GDP). As such, GDP measures the total value created in the production of goods and services by all resident units during the accounting period. The output of most goods or services is usually recorded when their production is completed. However, when it takes a long time to produce a unit of output, it becomes necessary to recognize that output is being produced continuously and to record it as a work-in-progress. For example, the production of certain agricultural goods or large durable goods such as ships or buildings may take months or years to complete. In such cases, it would distort economic reality to treat the output as if it were all produced at the moment of time when the process of production happens to terminate.Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is measured by the total value of a producers' acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain specified expenditure on services that adds to the value of non-produced assets. The boundary line between those products that are retained in the economy and are used for consumption and those products that are used for capital formation is known as the asset boundary. The asset boundary for fixed assets consists of goods and services that are used in production for more than one year. Two exclusions from the asset boundary should be noted. The first is that consumer durables are not treated as fixed assets. The second exclusion is pragmatic rather than conceptual and concerns small tools. Hand tools such as saws, spades, knives, axes, hammers, screwdrivers and spanners or wrenches are examples. If expenditures on such tools take place at a fairly steady rate and if their value is small compared with expenditures on more complex machinery and equipment, it may be appropriate to treat the tools as materials or supplies used for intermediate consumption. In countries in which they account for a significant part of the value of the total stock of an industry's durable producers' goods, they may be treated as fixed assets and their acquisition and disposal by producers recorded under gross fixed capital formation. Gross fixed capital formation may take the form of improvements to existing fixed assets, such as buildings and structures, that increase their productive capacity, extend their service lives, or both. A different treatment is applied to improvements to land in its natural state. In this case the improvements are treated as the creation of a new fixed asset and are not regarded as giving rise to an increase in the value of the natural resource. If land, once improved, is further improved, then the normal treatment of improvements to existing fixed assets applies. The Investment Ratio (IR) is obtained as the GFCF share to GDP.Gross Output (GO). At the most granular level, gross output consists of those goods and services that are produced within an establishment that become available for use outside that establishment, plus any goods and services produced for own final use. Industry gross output is the market value of the goods and services produced by an industry.Value added (VA) represents the contribution of labor and capital to the production process. Gross output relates directly to the concept of value added as the latter is obtained by subtracting the value of intermediate consumption evaluated at purchasers' prices from the value of output at basic prices. Although the outputs and inputs are valued using different sets of prices, for brevity the value added is described by the prices used to value the outputs. From the point of view of the producer, purchasers' prices for inputs and basic prices for outputs represent the prices actually paid and received. Their use leads to a measure of gross value added that is particularly relevant for the producer. Net value added is defined as the value of output less the values of both intermediate consumption and consumption of fixed capital.Gross National Income (GNI) is a measure of total incomes receivable in the economy. It is equal to GDP less primary incomes payable to non-resident units plus primary incomes receivable from non-resident units. In other words, GNI is equal to GDP less taxes (less subsidies) on production and imports, compensation of employees and property income payable to the rest of the world plus the corresponding items receivable from the rest of the world.\", 'periodicity': '(blank)', 'topic': 'Macro Indicators', 'created': '28-2-2022', 'last_modified': '28-2-2022', 'TriggerTalend': False, 'SavePathForJsonOutput': '//10.30.31.77/data_collection_dump/TestData'}}\n",

Additional variables included in the ACS are Net and Gross Capital Stock, Consumption of Fixed Capital, the Agriculture Investment ratio, and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index. The FAO Agriculture Capital Stock Database is an analytical database: whenever available, the database integrates official National Accounts data harvested from the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (UNSD AMA) and the OECD Annual National Accounts Database (OECD ANA). The database is further supplemented by OECD Structural Analysis database (OECD STAN) and in a few countries data from the country’s statistics website. If the full set of official data is not available for any specific country, imputation methods are applied to obtain estimates over the complete time series. Many data points in ACS are estimated and are flagged as such; they do not represent official Member countries' submissions. With a view of producing internationally comparable net capital stock estimates, we employ the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) with a time invariant geometric depreciation rate to impute missing data. The Perpetual Inventory Method is a well-established economic model to calculate Net Capital Stocks (NCS) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) from time series of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Specifically, annual measures of the NCS are obtained from cumulating historical series on physical investment flows and deducting the part of assets that are depreciated (the Consumption of Fixed Capital that occurs in every period). In order to implement the PIM, long time series on aggregate GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing is required. As much as possible, we rely on National Accounts data published by the OECD and UNSD. When country data are partially or fully missing, we employ econometric techniques to impute missing observations. Depending on the pattern of data missingness for the countries, different imputation methods are applied (selected from the ARMAX, PANEL and OLS classes of econometric models) for the data series from 1995 to 2018. The values of Agriculture Capital Stock related indicators for 2020, including Agriculture Investment Ratio, Agriculture Orientation Index, Net Capital Stock, Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Consumption of Fixed Capital, are estimated using the Holt-Winters (HW) method (Cipra et al., 1995). The HW method is an exponential smoothing method for forecasting the annual values of economic variables. In this context, the HW method relies on existing (historical) values of the Agriculture Capital Stock. The predicted value is an extrapolation of the historical values to the specified target date, which extends the timeline without considering seasonality in the annual series. All data series in the database are provided both in national currencies and in US dollars as well as in current prices and constant prices with base year 2015. Calculation of constant price series is done applying GFCF deflator series. When OECD National Accounts data are available, an OECD implicit deflator for agriculture GFCF is calculated and used. For other cases, the implicit deflators on GFCF for total economy available from the FAOSTAT Deflators database is used.\", 'JobType': 'JSON', 'CleanPush': True, 'Server': 'str', 'UseJsonFormatForSQL': False, 'CleanReplace': True, 'MergeSchema': False, 'tags': [{'name': 'Macro-Economic Indicators'}], 'additional_data_sources': [{'name': 'UNSD Official Country Data; OECD Annual National Accounts; OECD Structural Analysis Database. https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Introduction.asp; http://stats.oecd.org/.'}], 'limitations': '', 'concept': 'Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) – the total value of a producer’s acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets (such as subsoil assets or major improvements in the quantity, quality or productivity of land) realized by the productive activity of institutional units. Net Capital Stock (NCS) – the sum of the written-down values of all the fixed assets still in use is described as the net capital stock; it can also be described as the difference between gross capital stock and consumption of fixed capital. Consumption of fixed capital (CFC) – the decline, during the course of the accounting period, in the current value of the stock of fixed assets owned and used by a producer as a result of physical deterioration, normal obsolescence or normal accidental damage. A note on the non-financial Fixed Assets Boundary according to the SNA 2008. Fixed assets are produced assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in production processes for more than one year. They are divided into tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets. Examples of tangible produced fixed-assets are dwellings, non-residential buildings and structures (e.g. barns, warehouse, factories, major land improvements…), machinery and equipment, and cultivated assets. Examples of intangible fixed assets are mineral exploration, computer software, research and development and entertainment. Given the focus of the present FAO database on the agriculture, forestry and fishing industry, the following words of caution are in order: - An important element from the SNA definition of non-financial assets considered for capital stock calculation is that non-produced assets are excluded from the fixed assets boundary. Non-produced assets that occur in nature include natural resources, subsoil assets, non-cultivated biological resources and water resources. Other non-produced assets are licenses and marketing assets (including goodwill). That is, only land improvements and cultivated biological resources are part of the fixed capital base. - Cultivated biological resources cover animal resources yielding repeat products as well as tree, crop and plant resources yielding repeat products whose natural growth and regeneration is under the direct control, responsibility and management of institutional units. Examples of animal resources are breeding stocks, dairy cattle, draft animals, sheep used for wool production and animals used for transportation, racing or entertainment. Animals raised for slaughter, including poultry, are not fixed assets but inventories. Examples of tree, crop and plant resources are trees (including vines and shrubs) cultivated for fruits and nuts, for sap and resin and for bark and leaf products. Some examples of GFCF: o Sheep used in the production of wool; o Bull (male cow) used for breeding; o Chickens used to produce eggs; o A vine tree used to produce grapes for wine. Chickens for slaughter and sheep used for meat are not part of GFCF but of inventories. Agriculture Investment Ratio indicates the proportion of the industry-wide Value Added which constitutes the aggregate spending on Gross Fixed Capital Formation. This indicator is obtained as the share of GFCF over Value Added in agriculture, forestry and fishing. Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index indicates how the investment ratio in agriculture, forestry, and fishery compares to that of the total economy. This indicator is obtained as the ratio of the Agriculture Investment Ratio (Agriculture Gross Fixed Capital Formation as a share of Agriculture Value Added) and the total economy investment ratio (Total Economy Gross Fixed Capital Formation as a share of Total Economy Value Added).', 'periodicity': '', 'topic': 'Capital Stock', 'created': '30 September 2022', 'last_modified': '30 September 2022', 'TriggerTalend': False, 'SavePathForJsonOutput': '//10.30.31.77/data_collection_dump/TestData'}}\n",

The three food value measures differ for the bundle of goods and services they account for. In particular, the FAH refers to domestic expenditures of personal consumption for food consumed at home, at purchaser prices. The FTAH measure is similar in its target, but it refers to a broader set of economic goods, inclusive of tobacco, as food and tobacco expenditures are not always separable in the original data. On the other side, the FAAFH refers to domestic expenditures of personal consumption for food consumed away from home (e.g. in restaurants), at purchaser prices, and it also includes expenditures for accommodation in all the cases where the two types of expenditures were not separable in the original data. The values of industry decomposition measure the food production value-added distribution across different industries and factors involved in the agri-food value chain. All these estimates are based on Leontief Input Ouput modeling and Industry reduction method. The Food Value Chain domain aims to supply informaitonrelevant for the SDG 12 - sustainable consumption and production patterns, SDG 2 - zero hunger and SDG 1 - no poverty, that constitue guiding SDGs in the FAO Strategic Framework 2022-2031 and its better production pillar.

Data are computed following the Tier 1 methods of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National greenhouse gas (GHG) Inventories(IPCC, 1996; 1997; 2000; 2002; 2006; 2014). Emissions from other economic sectors as defined by the IPCC are also disseminated in the domain for completeness. The domain includes methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from all the above activities as well as the aggregate fluorinated gases (F-gases) emissions used in industrial processes. Estimates are available by country, with global coverage for the period 1961–2020 with projections for 2030 and 2050 for some categories of emissions or 1990–2020 for others. The database is updated annually\\nThe FAOSTAT domain Emissions Totals disseminates information estimates for the single gases and their aggregates in CO2eq in units of kilotonnes (kt or 10*6 kg). The latter are computed by using the IPCC Fifth Assessment report global warming potentials, AR5 (IPCC, 2014).\\nEmissions from agrifood systems are those generated within farm gate, those associated with the land use change and the emissions from pre- and post-production food processes. The latter emissions are calculated based on data from the UN Statistical Division (UNSD), the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other third-party as well as by integrating emission information from the PRIMAP-hist dataset v2.4 (Gütschow et al., 2022). Methodologies for these estimates are described in dedicated working papers as follows: I) food transport; II) food systems waste disposal and III) fertilizers manufacturing, food processing, retail, packaging and household consumption. It should be noted that, the world aggregate estimates of food transport also includes international bunkers related to food. Emissions from “International Bunkers” is derived from data on ‘International aviation’ and ‘International navigation/shipping’ of the EDGARv6.0 dataset (JRC/PBL, 2019), covering the period 1990–2018 and extrapolated linearly to 2020 by FAOSTAT Domain Emissions Totals. Emissions for this category are only available for the world aggregate.\\nPRIMAP data for other IPCC sectors is also disseminated for completeness and in view of computing shares of emissions for the whole economy (these are disseminate separately in the FAOSTAT domain Emissions shares). The IPCC economic sectors are: energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), waste and other n.e.c. These data are sourced from the PRIMAP-hist v2.4 dataset (Gütschow et al., 2022).\\nEmissions Totals jointly disseminates the emissions reported by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Emission data are sourced directly from the UNFCCC data portal as submitted by countries through their most recent GHG National Inventories (NGHGI) or are extracted from Biennial Update Reports (BURs).UNFCCC data are disseminated in FAOSTAT with permission, formalized via a FAO-UNFCCC Memorandum of Understanding.

Data are computed geospatially using Tier 1 default factors of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National greenhouse gas (GHG) Inventories and of the Supplement on Wetlands (IPCC, 2006; 2014) for the organic soils component. Estimates are available by country and with global coverage, in complete time series for the period 1990–2021. The database is updated annually.\\nThe FAOSTAT domain Fires disseminates information by country on: activity data (in hectares of burned area and tonnes of burned biomass); and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in kilotonnes of N2O, CH4 and CO2). Data are available for all countries and territories, for standard FAOSTAT regional aggregations, and for Annex I and non-Annex I country groups.\\nThe uncertainties in FAOSTAT estimates of emissions from fires in organic soils area very high (IPCC, 2014). FAOSTAT estimates rely on remotely sensed data of burning biomass in areas where organic soils are also mapped. On the one hand, the presence of fires may not always be a signal that the underlying peat layer is burning. On the other hand, remote sensing information has limited capacity to detect the smoldering fires that are typical of peatlands. Furthermore, the methods applied herein do not distinguish between fires on drained and undrained organic soils, rather assuming burning of the organic layer in both cases. Existing literature and country reports support FAOSTAT country estimates in South East Asia (e.g. Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam), where burning of the organic layer is associated with deforestation fires and drainage. In all other countries, absence of literature and lack of other evidence suggest that FAOSTAT emissions data from fires in organic soils should be used with caution, as a tool to investigate possible national hotspots, rather than for evaluating national GHG inventory data. There is insufficient information to date to confirm the actual presence, quantity and causes (i.e. human-induced vs wildfires) of fires in organic soils outside Southeastern Asia.\\nThis FAOSTAT domain also disseminates the activity data and emissions data reported by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on fire disturbance for a range of vegetation types in Forest Land and Grassland and from fires in organic soils.

A logarithmic function was chosen due to independent findings on the significant correlation between the percentage change in national GDP and the annual growth rate of food waste per capita, using World Bank What a Waste Report 2.0 data. This model builds on a meta-analysis of food waste publications that established a similar relationship between GDP and food waste (Xue et al., 2017).
