      " title : Consumer Price Index (CPI)  , description : Consumer price indexes (CPIs) are index numbers that measure changes in the prices of goods and services purchased or otherwise acquired by households, which households use directly, or indirectly, to satisfy their own needs and wants. In practice, most CPIs are calculated as weighted averages of the percentage price changes for a speciﬁed set, or ‘‘basket’’, of consumer products, the weights reﬂecting their relative importance in household consumption in some period. CPIs are widely used to index pensions and social security benefits. CPIs are also used to index other payments, such as interest payments or rents, or the prices of bonds. CPIs are also commonly used as a proxy for the general rate of inﬂation, even though they measure only consumer inﬂation. They are used by some governments or central banks to set inﬂation targets for purposes of monetary policy. The price data collected for CPI purposes can also be used to compile other indices, such as the price indices used to deﬂate household consumption expenditures in national accounts, or the purchasing power parities used to compare real levels of consumption in different countries.  In an effort to further coordinate and harmonize the collection of CPI data, the international organizations agreed that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) would assume responsibility for the international collection and dissemination of national CPI data. Under this data collection initiative, countries are reporting the aggregate all items index; more detailed indexes and weights for 12 subgroups of consumption expenditure (according to the so-called COICOP-classification), and detailed metadata. These detailed data represent a valuable resource for data users throughout the world and this portal would not be possible without the ongoing cooperation of all reporting countries. In this effort, the OECD collects and validates the data for their member countries, including accession and key partner countries, whereas the IMF takes care of the collection of data for all other countries., periodicity : Annual,Monthly,Quarterly, lase modified : 02/16/2023, created : <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/guides/cpi/index.htm#manual\" target = \"_blank\">Consumer Price Index Manual</i></a> ,concept: <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/guides/cpi/index.htm#manual\" target = \"_blank\">Consumer Price Index Manual</i></a>, topic: 512\n",

      " title : MCD Regional Economic Outlook (MCDREO)  , description : Economic developments in the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP) continue to reflect the diversity of conditions prevailing across the region. Most high-income oil exporters, primarily in the GCC, continue to record steady growth and solid economic and financial fundamentals, albeit with medium-term challenges that need to be addressed. In contrast, other countries --Iraq, Libya, Syria -- mired in conflicts with not just humanitarian but also economic consequences. And yet other countries, mostly oil importers, are making continued but uneven progress in advancing their economic agenda, often in tandem with political transitions and amidst difficult social conditions. In most of these countries, without extensive economic and structural reforms, economic prospects for the medium term remain insufficient to reduce high unemployment and improve living standards. Economic activity in the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) region is weakening, mainly because of the near-term slowdown and rising regional tensions affecting Russia, a key trading partner and sources of remittance and investment inflows, as well as weaker domestic demand in a number of CCA countries. Near-term risks are to the downside and tied to the fortunes of large trading partners. Policies need to focus on bolstering economic stability and, where needed, short-term support to ailing economic growth. In addition, a new model for high, sustained, diversified, and inclusive growth is needed to set the direction for economic policies for the next decade., periodicity : Annual,Quarterly, lase modified : <p><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2016/032216.htm\" target = \"_blank\" STYLE=\"TEXT-DECORATION: NONE\"><font color=\"#989898\">Introductory Remarks for Long-Term Growth Prospects in the Middle East and Central Asia</font></a></p><p><a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2014/08/01/links-and-levers-how-the-caucasus-and-central-asia-are-tied-to-russia/\" target = \"_blank\" STYLE=\"TEXT-DECORATION: NONE\"><font color=\"#989898\">Links and Levers: How the Caucasus and Central Asia Are Tied to Russia</font></a></p><p><a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2014/04/11/arab-economic-transformation-amid-political-transitions/\" target = \"_blank\" STYLE=\"TEXT-DECORATION: NONE\"><font color=\"#989898\">Arab Economic Transformation amid Political Transitions</font></a></p><p><a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2013/03/27/support-the-people-not-energy-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/\" target = \"_blank\" STYLE=\"TEXT-DECORATION: NONE\"><font color=\"#989898\">Support the People, Not Energy, in the Middle East and North Africa</font></a></p><p><a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2013/03/27/support-the-people-not-energy-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/\" target = \"_blank\" STYLE=\"TEXT-DECORATION: NONE\"><font color=\"#989898\">Financial Support for Arab Countries in Transition</font></a></p><p><a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2013/02/28/moving-beyond-crisis-management-in-the-west-bank-and-gaza/\" target = \"_blank\" STYLE=\"TEXT-DECORATION: NONE\"><font color=\"#989898\">Moving Beyond Crisis Management in the West Bank and Gaza</font></a></p><p><a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2013/12/19/pakistan-the-realities-of-economic-reform/\" target = \"_blank\" STYLE=\"TEXT-DECORATION: NONE\"><font color=\"#989898\">Pakistan: The Realities of Economic Reform</font></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/vc/2014/050514.htm\" target = \"_blank\" STYLE=\"TEXT-DECORATION: NONE\"><font color=\"#989898\">Time for More Jobs and Growth in the Arab Countries in Transition (Masood Ahmed)</font></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/vc/2013/053013.htm\" target = \"_blank\" STYLE=\"TEXT-DECORATION: NONE\"><font color=\"#989898\">New Rules Needed for Setting Energy Prices in the Middle East (Masood Ahmed)</font></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/vc/2013/051913.htm\" target = \"_blank\" STYLE=\"TEXT-DECORATION: NONE\"><font color=\"#989898\">Growth and Jobs to Meet the Aspirations of the Arab Countries in Transition (Masood Ahmed)</font></a></p>, created : 10/30/2022 ,concept: 10/30/2022, topic: Annual data.\n",
