The database includes information collected for cyclones (for the period between 1980 and 2000), droughts (between 1980 and 2000), earthquakes (between 1976 and 2002), floods (between 1985 and 2003), landslides, and volcano eruptions (between 79 and 2000). Data are published with a spatial resolution ranging from a 30 by 30 arc second grid to a 2.5 by 2.5 arc degree grid for cyclones, earthquakes, landslides, volcanoes, droughts and floods. Data for floods are less reliable or missing in the early-mid 1990s. For each single hazard, all grid cells with occurrence data were divided into deciles, 10 classes consisting of approximately equal numbers of grid cells. The higher the value of the grid cell, the higher the decile ranking and the greater the frequency of the hazard relative to other cells (Dilley et al., 2005: 23-34 - Dilley, M, Chen, R.S., Deichmann, U., Lerner-Lam, A.L., Arnold, M., Agwe, J., Buys, P., Kjekstad, O., Lyon, B., and Yetman, G.

In classifying the degree of risk exposure of a city to hotspots of a specific hazard, the highest cell value of grids is used when the city’s buffer zones overlap with surrounding grid cells of that particular hazard.  ,\\n nan ,\\n (1) Data refer to the Governorate of Grand Algiers. ,\\n (2) Data for Buenos Aires refer to Gran Buenos Aires. ,\\n (3) Data for Córdoba refer to Gran Córdoba. ,\\n (4) Data for Mendoza refer to Gran Mendoza. ,\\n (5) Data for San Miguel de Tucumán refer to Gran San Miguel de Tucumán . ,\\n (6) Based on the concept of a functional and structural urban area (Stadtregion) consisting of an urban core area (Kernzone) and surrounding urban areas (Außenzone).

Major sources of data on marital status presented in World Marriage Data 2019 are censuses, sample surveys and national estimates based on population register data or estimation methods using census data. \\xa0           ', 'periodicity': '', 'topic': 'World Marriage Data', 'created': '', 'last_modified': '', 'TriggerTalend': False, 'SavePathForJsonOutput': ''}}\n",

Some other IPUMS-I samples group parents and grandparents of the head into a single category.

These two sets of model life tables, designed primarily for use in developing countries or for estimating historic populations, are limited to mortality patterns for a life span from age 20 to 75. A revised set of model life tables, extending the initials sets from life expectancy at birth (e(0)) from age 75.0 up to 92.5, uses both a limited life table as an asymptotic pattern and the classic Lee-Carter approach to derive intermediate age patterns (Buettner, 2002). With the extension of the projection horizon for all countries up to 2100 as part of the 2012 revision of World Population Prospects, life expectancy at birth was extended beyond 92.5 years. In-depth analysis of an initial extension of the model life tables, carried out in 1998, revealed substantial deviation for out-of-sample predictions compared to results from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) at very low mortality levels (Wilmoth and others, 2012) and the need for a smoother transition between the existing set of model life tables up to age 75 and above. A new set of extended model-life tables (Gerland and Li (2011) imposed constraints to ensure greater convergence with the HMD at high levels of life expectancy at birth. The nine sets of regional model life tables (four Coale-Demeny model life-table regional patterns (East, North, South and West) and five United Nations model life-table regional patterns (Latin American, Chilean, South Asian, Far Eastern, General), extended up to 100 years of life expectancy at birth, were blended with the existing ones to ensure smooth mortality surfaces by age and sex and levels of life expectancy at birth. The new model life tables are available by abridged age groups (0-1,1-4,5-9, etc.) and by single year of age (0,1,2,3, etc.) (United Nations, 2011). In both cases the life tables have been extended up to age 130. Each dataset is available for life expectancy at birth from age 20 up to 100 by 1 year or 2.5-year increment.
